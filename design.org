* assembler and VM for the BETA CPU
<2020-09-23 Wed>

The goal is to get tinyOS running on this, running a webserver that is
keeping track of the VM state,

Maybe there is a display. 

** Stages.

*** first stage defines the macros
    
*** second stage <2020-09-23 Wed>
expand the macros until they are all expanded.
if there are any callable forms left, then a macro was not defined.

- TODO all macro definitions need to go into the multiargument vector
  also, make a cleaner/std interface for storing/getting macros from the
  environment.

- TODO consider assignments inside macros .. they should be local to
  the macro, or not be allowed at all.


*** stage three 
**** Next byte to be assembled
this is tracked in the environment for now. 
lisp has dibs on the dot (.) char, so use ($) instead.

uasm uses . = 24
this will use (= $ 24)
